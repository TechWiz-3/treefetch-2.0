# Treefetch

Treefetch currently looks like this:

<img src="/screenshots/mac_one.png" height=300>  
<img src="/screenshots/ubuntu_two.png" height=300>  

Treefetch uses a bash script to print the tree, and python utils to get the system information. The goal is to be accurate across platforms while being concise and simple to understand.

## :pray: Ways you can help

**In general:**
* Test treefetch on your system, report any issues, PR any changes you wish to make.
* Take a look at the [utilities](./utils) and help improve them with a PR or suggest something in an issue.

[**`get_desktop`**](./utils/get_desktop)
* Test the utility and help improve it to include more desktop managers and improve it's accuracy
* Work on other methods to get the desktop environment if `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` env variable does not exist

[**`get_wm`**](./utils/get_wm)
* Review code and PR any logic issues or any improvements
* Test on your system/s and submit an issue if something is wrong
* Review window managers list for each platform (win, mac, linux)

## :monocle_face: Origin
This project is a different implementation of another project with similar output, that project is named [tfetch](https://github.com/Endlassy/tfetch). This project is NOT related to the [treefetch](https://github.com/angelofallars/treefetch) project, which is in written in rust and displays physical ascii trees (check it out tho, it's pretty cool).
